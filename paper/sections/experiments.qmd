# Experiments {#sec-experiments}

In this section, we present experiments that we have conducted in order to answer the following research questions:

::: {#cor-plaus}

## Plausibility

Does our proposed counterfactual training objective (@eq-obj) induce models to learn plausible explanations?

:::

::: {#cor-action}

## Actionability

Does our proposed counterfactual training objective (@eq-obj) yield more favorable algorithmic recourse outcomes in the presence of actionability constraints?

:::

Beyond this, we are also interested in understanding how robust our answers to @cor-plaus and @cor-action are:

::: {#cor-hyper}

## Hyperparameters 

What are the effects of different hyperparameter choices with respect to @eq-obj?
