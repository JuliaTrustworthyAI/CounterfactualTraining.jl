\title{Recent Advances in Underwater Basket Weaving Under the Extreme Pressure of the Mariana Trench}

\titlerunning{Underwater Basket Weaving Under Extreme Pressure}
% If the full title of your paper is short enough to also fit in the running head, you can omit the abbreviated paper title here. You can check as follows: if you comment out the \titlerunning line, something will appear in the header of all odd-numbered pages of your PDF from page 3 onward. This something is either the full title (in which case all is well), or the error message "Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length". If this error message appears, you're going to want to provide an abbreviated title within the \titlerunning command, because if you won't do it, Springer will do it for you.

%N.B.: Author information (both in the \author{} and \authorrunning{} command) should only be present in the Camera-Ready Version of your paper. The version that you initially submit for review, ought to be double-blind. So, when initially submitting your paper, use:
%\author{Author information scrubbed for double-blind reviewing}
\author{Andr\'e Lauren Benjamin\inst{1} \and
Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.\inst{2,3} \corr \and
Antwan Andr\'e Patton\inst{1}\orcidID{0000-1111-2222-3333}}
% You may leave out the orcidID information, if you want to.
% Use \corr to indicate the corresponding author. Note the spacing around the \corr command. Only one author can be the corresponding author.

%N.B.: comment out the \authorrunning{} command for the double-blind version of your paper submitted for review. Later, if your paper is accepted, use the command for the Camera-Ready Version.
\authorrunning{A.L. Benjamin et al.}
% First names are abbreviated in the running head.
% If there is one author, write 'A.L. Benjamin'.
% If there are two authors, write 'A.L. Benjamin and C.C. Broadus Jr.'
% If there are more than two authors, '[...] et al.' is used.
