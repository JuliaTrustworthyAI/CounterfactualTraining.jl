# Counterfactual Training {#sec-method}

Counterfactual training combines ideas from adversarial training, energy-based modelling and counterfactuals explanations with the explicit objective of aligning representations with plausible explanations that comply with user requirements. In the context of CE, plausibility has broadly been defined as the degree to which counterfactuals comply with the underlying data generating process [@poyiadzi2020face;@guidotti2022counterfactual;@altmeyer2024faithful]. Plausibility is a necessary but insufficient condition for using CE to provide algorithmic recourse (AR) to individuals affected by opaque models in practice. This is because for recourse recommendations to be **actionable**, they need to not only result in plausible counterfactuals but also be attainable. A plausible CE for a rejected 20-year-old loan applicant, for example, might reveal that their application would have been accepted, if only they were 20 years older. Ignoring all other features, this complies with the definition of plausibility if 40-year-old individuals are in fact more credit-worthy on average than young adults. But of course this CE does not qualify for providing actionable recourse to the applicant. For our intents and purposes, counterfactual training aims at improving model explainability by aligning models with counterfactuals that meet both desiderata, plausibility and actionability. Formally, we define explainability as follows:

::: {#def-explainability}

## Model Explainability

Let $\mathbf{M}_\theta: \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathcal{Y}$ denote a supervised classification model that maps from the $D$-dimensional input space $\mathcal{X}$ to representations $\phi(\mathbf{x};\theta)$ and finally to the $K$-dimensional output space $\mathcal{Y}$. Assume that for any given input-output pair $\{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\}_i$ there exists a counterfactual $\mathbf{x}^{\prime} = \mathbf{x} + \Delta: \mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}) = \mathbf{y}^{+} \neq \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ where $\mathbf{y}^{+}$ denotes some target output. We say that $\mathbf{M}_\theta$ is **explainable** to the extent that faithfully generated counterfactuals are plausible (i.e. consistent with the data) and actionable. Formally, we define these properties as follows:

1. (Plausibility) $\int^{A} p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}^{+})d\mathbf{x} \rightarrow 1$ where $A$ is some small region around $\mathbf{x}^{\prime}$.
2. (Actionability) Permutations $\Delta$ are subject to actionability constraints.

We consider counterfactuals as faithful to the extent that they are consistent with what the model has learned about the input data. Let $p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}^{+})$ denote the conditional posterior over inputs, then formally:

3. (Faithfulness) $\int^{A} p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}^{+})d\mathbf{x} \rightarrow 1$ where $A$ is defined as above.

:::

The definitions of faithfulness and plausibility in @def-explainability are the same as in @altmeyer2024faithful, with adapted notation. Actionability constraints in @def-explainability vary and depend on the context in which $\mathbf{M}_\theta$ is deployed. In this work, we focus on domain and mutability constraints for individual features $x_d$ for $d=1,...,D$. We limit ourselves to classification tasks for reasons discussed in @sec-discussion.

## Our Proposed Objective

To train models with high explainability as defined in @def-explainability, we propose the following objective,

$$
\text{yloss}(\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x}),y) + \lambda_{\text{div}} \text{div}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x^\prime};\theta) + \lambda_{\text{adv}} \text{advloss}(\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x^\prime}),y)
$$ {#eq-obj}

where $\text{yloss}(\cdot)$ denotes any conventional classification loss function (e.g. cross-entropy) that induces discriminative (predictive) performance. The two additional components in @eq-obj are explained in more detail below. For now, they can be sufficiently described as inducing explainability directly and indirectly by penalizing: 1) the contrastive divergence, $\text{div}(\cdot)$, between counterfactuals $x^\prime$ and observed samples $x$ and, 2) the adversarial loss, $\text{advloss}(.)$, with respect to counterfactuals. The tradeoff between the different components can be governed by adjusting the strengths of the penalties $\lambda_{\text{div}}$ and $\lambda_{\text{adv}}$.

### Directly Inducing Explainability through Contrastive Divergence

@grathwohl2020your observe that any classifier can be re-interpreted as a joint energy-based model (JEM) that learns to discriminate output classes conditional on inputs and generate inputs. They show that JEMs can be trained to perform well at both tasks by directly maximizing the joint log-likelihood factorized as $\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\log p_\theta(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}) + \log p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$. The first factor can be optimized using conventional cross-entropy as in @eq-obj. To optimize $\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ @grathwohl2020your minimize the contrastive divergence between samples drawn from $p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ and training observations, i.e. samples from $p(\mathbf{x})$. 

A key empirical finding in @altmeyer2024faithful was that JEMs tend to do well with respect to the plausibility objective in @def-explainability. If we consider samples drawn from $p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ as counterfactuals, this is an expected finding, because the JEM objective effectively minimizes the divergence between the conditional posterior and $p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}^{+})$. To generate samples, @grathwohl2020your rely on Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) using an uninformative prior for initialization. This is where we depart from their methodology: instead of generating samples through SGLD, we propose using counterfactual explainers to generate counterfactuals for observed training samples. Specifically, we have

$$
\text{div}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x^\prime};\theta) = \mathcal{E}_\theta(\mathbf{x}) - \mathcal{E}_\theta(\mathbf{x}^\prime)
$$ {#eq-div}

where $\mathcal{E}_\theta(\cdot)$ denotes the energy function. We generate samples $\mathbf{x}^\prime$ by first randomly sampling the target class $\mathbf{y}^+ \sim p(\mathbf{y})$ and then generating a counterfactual explanation for that target, similar to how conditional sampling can be used for JEMs [@grathwohl2020your]. Intuitively, the gradient of @eq-div decreases the energy of observed training samples (positive samples) while at same time increasing the energy of counterfactuals (negative samples) [@du2019implicit]. As the generated counterfactuals get more plausible (@def-explainability) over the cause of training, these two opposing effects gradually balance each out [@lippe2024uvadlc]. 

The departure from SGLD allows us to tap into the vast repertoire of explainers that have been proposed in the literature to meet different desiderata. Typically, these methods facilitate the imposition of domain and mutability constraints, for example. In principle, any existing approach for generating counterfactual explanations is viable, so long as it does not violate the faithfulness condition. Like JEMs [@murphy2022probabilistic], counterfactual training can be considered as a form of contrastive representation learning. 

### Indirectly Inducing Explainability through Adversarial Robustness

Based on our analysis in @sec-lit, counterfactuals $\mathbf{x}^\prime$ can be repurposed as additional training samples [@luu2023counterfactual] or adversarial examples [@freiesleben2022intriguing;@pawelczyk2022exploring]. This leaves some flexibility with respect to the exact choice for $\text{advloss}(\cdot)$ in @eq-obj. An intuitive functional form to use, though likely not the only reasonable choice, is inspired by adversarial training:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{advloss}(\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x^\prime}),\mathbf{y};\varepsilon)&=\begin{cases}
\text{yloss}(\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x^\prime}),\mathbf{y}) & \text{if} \ ||\Delta||_\infty \leq \varepsilon \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-adv}

Under this choice we treat the counterfactual $\mathbf{x}^\prime$ as an adversarial example iff it is imperceptible, i.e. the magnitude of the perturbation of any individual feature is upper-bounded at $\varepsilon$.
