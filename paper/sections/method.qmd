# Counterfactual Training {#sec-method}

Counterfactual training combines ideas from adversarial training, energy-based modelling and counterfactuals explanations with the explicit objective of aligning representations with plausible explanations that comply with user requirements. In the context of CE, plausibility has broadly been defined as the degree to which counterfactuals comply with the underlying data generating process [@poyiadzi2020face;@guidotti2022counterfactual;@altmeyer2024faithful]. Plausibility is a necessary but insufficient condition for using CE to provide algorithmic recourse (AR) to individuals affected by opaque models in practice. This is because for recourse recommendations to be **actionable**, they need to not only result in plausible counterfactuals but also be attainable. A plausible CE for a rejected 20-year-old loan applicant, for example, might reveal that their application would have been accepted, if only they were 20 years older. Ignoring all other features, this complies with the definition of plausibility if 40-year-old individuals are in fact more credit-worthy on average than young adults. But of course this CE does not qualify for providing actionable recourse to the applicant since *age* is not a mutable feature. For our intents and purposes, counterfactual training aims at improving model explainability by aligning models with counterfactuals that meet both desiderata, plausibility and actionability. Formally, we define explainability as follows:

::: {#def-explainability}

## Model Explainability

Let $\mathbf{M}_\theta: \mathcal{X} \mapsto \mathcal{Y}$ denote a supervised classification model that maps from the $D$-dimensional input space $\mathcal{X}$ to representations $\phi(\mathbf{x};\theta)$ and finally to the $K$-dimensional output space $\mathcal{Y}$. Assume that for any given input-output pair $\{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\}_i$ there exists a counterfactual $\mathbf{x}^{\prime} = \mathbf{x} + \Delta: \mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}) = \mathbf{y}^{+} \neq \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ where $\mathbf{y}^{+}$ denotes some target output. We say that $\mathbf{M}_\theta$ is **explainable** to the extent that faithfully generated counterfactuals are plausible (i.e. consistent with the data) and actionable. Formally, we define these properties as follows:

1. (Plausibility) $\int^{A} p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}^{+})d\mathbf{x} \rightarrow 1$ where $A$ is some small region around $\mathbf{x}^{\prime}$.
2. (Actionability) Permutations $\Delta$ are subject to actionability constraints.

We consider counterfactuals as faithful to the extent that they are consistent with what the model has learned about the input data. Let $p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}^{+})$ denote the conditional posterior over inputs, then formally:

3. (Faithfulness) $\int^{A} p_\theta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}^{+})d\mathbf{x} \rightarrow 1$ where $A$ is defined as above.

:::

The definitions of faithfulness and plausibility in @def-explainability are the same as in @altmeyer2024faithful, with adapted notation. Actionability constraints in @def-explainability vary and depend on the context in which $\mathbf{M}_\theta$ is deployed. In this work, we focus on domain and mutability constraints for individual features $x_d$ for $d=1,...,D$. We limit ourselves to classification tasks for reasons discussed in @sec-discussion.

## Our Proposed Objective

Let $\mathbf{x}_t^\prime$ for $t=0,...,T$ denote iteratively generated counterfactuals. To train models with high explainability as defined in @def-explainability, we propose to leverage counterfactuals in the following objective,

$$
\min_\theta \text{yloss}(\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x}),\mathbf{y}) + \lambda_{\text{div}} \text{div}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_T^\prime,y;\theta) + \lambda_{\text{adv}} \text{advloss}(\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t\leq T}^\prime),\mathbf{y})
$$ {#eq-obj}

where $\text{yloss}(\cdot)$ is any conventional classification loss that induces discriminative performance (e.g. cross-entropy). The two additional components in @eq-obj are explained in more detail below. For now, they can be sufficiently described as inducing explainability directly and indirectly by penalizing: 1) the contrastive divergence, $\text{div}(\cdot)$, between counterfactuals $\mathbf{x}_T^\prime$ and observed samples $x$ and, 2) the adversarial loss, $\text{advloss}(.)$, with respect to nascent counterfactuals $\mathbf{x}_{t\leq T}^\prime$. The tradeoff between the different components can be governed by adjusting the strengths of the penalties $\lambda_{\text{div}}$ and $\lambda_{\text{adv}}$.

### Directly Inducing Explainability through Contrastive Divergence

@grathwohl2020your observe that any classifier can be re-interpreted as a joint energy-based model (JEM) that learns to discriminate output classes conditional on inputs and generate inputs. They show that JEMs can be trained to perform well at both tasks by directly maximizing the joint log-likelihood factorized as $\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\log p_\theta(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}) + \log p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$. The first factor can be optimized using conventional cross-entropy as in @eq-obj. To optimize $\log p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ @grathwohl2020your minimize the contrastive divergence between samples drawn from $p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ and training observations, i.e. samples from $p(\mathbf{x})$. 

A key empirical finding in @altmeyer2024faithful was that JEMs tend to do well with respect to the plausibility objective in @def-explainability. If we consider samples drawn from $p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ as counterfactuals, this is an expected finding, because the JEM objective effectively minimizes the divergence between the conditional posterior and $p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}^{+})$. To generate samples, @grathwohl2020your rely on Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) using an uninformative prior for initialization. This is where we depart from their methodology: instead of generating samples through SGLD, we propose using counterfactual explainers to generate counterfactuals for observed training samples. Specifically, we have

$$
\text{div}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_T^\prime,y;\theta) = \mathcal{E}_\theta(\mathbf{x},y) - \mathcal{E}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_T^\prime,y)
$$ {#eq-div}

where $\mathcal{E}_\theta(\cdot)$ denotes the energy function. In particular, we set $\mathcal{E}_\theta(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=-\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x})[y^+]$ where $y^+$ denotes the index of the target class. We generate samples $\mathbf{x}_T^\prime$ by first randomly sampling the target class $y^+ \sim p(y)$ and then generating a counterfactual explanation for that target over $T$ iterations using a gradient-based counterfactual generator. This is similar to how conditional sampling is used to draw from $p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ in @grathwohl2020your. 

Intuitively, the gradient of @eq-div decreases the energy of observed training samples (positive samples) while at same time increasing the energy of counterfactuals (negative samples) [@du2019implicit]. As the generated counterfactuals get more plausible (@def-explainability) over the cause of training, these two opposing effects gradually balance each out [@lippe2024uvadlc]. 

The departure from SGLD allows us to tap into the vast repertoire of explainers that have been proposed in the literature to meet different desiderata. Typically, these methods facilitate the imposition of domain and mutability constraints, for example. In principle, any existing approach for generating counterfactual explanations is viable, so long as it does not violate the faithfulness condition. Like JEMs [@murphy2022probabilistic], counterfactual training can be considered as a form of contrastive representation learning. 

### Indirectly Inducing Explainability through Adversarial Robustness

Based on our analysis in @sec-lit, counterfactuals $\mathbf{x}^\prime$ can be repurposed as additional training samples [@luu2023counterfactual;@balashankar2023improving] or adversarial examples [@freiesleben2022intriguing;@pawelczyk2022exploring]. This leaves some flexibility with respect to the exact choice for $\text{advloss}(\cdot)$ in @eq-obj. An intuitive functional form to use, though likely not the only reasonable choice, is inspired by adversarial training:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{advloss}(\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t\leq T}^\prime),\mathbf{y};\varepsilon)&=\text{yloss}(\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{t_\varepsilon}^\prime),\mathbf{y}) \\
t_\varepsilon &= \max_t \{t: ||\Delta_t||_\infty < \varepsilon\}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-adv}

Under this choice, we consider nascent counterfactuals $\mathbf{x}_{t\leq T}^\prime$ as adversarial examples as long as the magnitude of the perturbation to any individual feature is at most $\varepsilon$. This is closely aligned with @szegedy2013intriguing, who define an adversarial attack as an "imperceptible non-random perturbation". Thus, we choose to work with a different distinction between CE and AE than @freiesleben2022intriguing, who considers misclassification as the key distinguishing feature of AE. One of the key observations in this work is that we can leverage counterfactual explanations during training and get adversarial examples, essentially for free. 

## Encoding Actionability Constraints {#sec-constraints}

Many existing counterfactual explainers support domain and mutability constraints out-of-the-box. In fact, both types of constraints can be implemented for any counterfactual explainer that relies on gradient descent in the feature space for optimization [@altmeyer2023explaining]. In this context, domain constraints can be imposed by simply projecting counterfactuals back to the specified domain, if the previous gradient step resulted in updated feature values that were out-of-domain. Mutability constraints can similarly be enforced by setting partial derivatives to zero to ensure that features are only mutated in the allowed direction, if at all. 

Since actionability constraints are binding at test time, we should also impose them when generating $\mathbf{x}^\prime$ during each training iteration to align model representations with user requirements. Through their effect on $\mathbf{x}^\prime$, both types of constraints influence model outcomes through @eq-div. Here it is crucial that we avoid penalizing implausibility that arises due to mutability constraints. For any mutability-constrained feature $d$ this can be achieved by enforcing $\mathbf{x}[d] - \mathbf{x}^\prime[d]:=0$ whenever perturbing $\mathbf{x}^\prime[d]$ in the direction of $\mathbf{x}[d]$ would violate mutability constraints. Specifically, we set $\mathbf{x}[d] := \mathbf{x}^\prime[d]$ if 

1. Feature $d$ is strictly immutable in practice.
2. We have $\mathbf{x}[d]>\mathbf{x}^\prime[d]$ but feature $d$ can only be decreased in practice.
3. We have $\mathbf{x}[d]<\mathbf{x}^\prime[d]$ but feature $d$ can only be increased in practice.

From a Bayesian perspective, setting $\mathbf{x}[d] := \mathbf{x}^\prime[d]$ can be understood as assuming a point mass prior for $p(\mathbf{x})$ with respect to feature $d$. Intuitively, we think of this simply in terms ignoring implausibility costs with respect to immutable features, which effectively forces the model to instead seek plausibility with respect to the remaining features. This in turn results in lower overall sensitivity to immutable features, which we demonstrate empirically for different classifiers in @sec-experiments. Under certain conditions, this results holds theoretically[For the proof, see the supplementary appendix.]:

::: {#prp-mtblty}

## Protecting Immutable Features

Let $f_\theta(\mathbf{x})=\mathcal{S}(\mathbf{M}_\theta(\mathbf{x}))=\mathcal{S}(\Theta\mathbf{x})$ denote a linear classifier with softmax activation $\mathcal{S}$ (i.e. *multinomial logistic regression*) where $y\in\{1,...,K\}=\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^D$. If we assume multivariate Gaussian class densities with common diagonal covariance matrix $\Sigma_k=\Sigma$ for all $k \in \mathcal{K}$, then protecting an immutable feature from the contrastive divergence penalty (@eq-div) will result in lower classifier sensitivity to that feature relative to the remaining features, provided that at least one of those is mutable and discriminative.

:::

It is worth highlighting that @prp-mtblty assumes independence of features. This raises a valid concern about the effect of protecting immutable features in the presence of proxy features that remain unprotected. We discuss this limitation in @sec-discussion.

## Illustration

To better convey the intuition underlying our proposed method, we illustrate different model outcomes in @exm-grad.

## Prediction of Consumer Credit Default

Suppose we are interested in predicting the likelihood that loan applicants default on their credit. We have access to historical data on previous loan takers comprised of a binary outcome variable ($y\in\{1=\text{default},2=\text{no default}\}$) two input features: 1) the subjects' *age*, which we define as immutable, and 2) the subjects' existing level of *debt*, which we define as mutable. 

We have simulated this scenario using synthetic data with independent features and Gaussian class-conditional densities in @fig-poc. The four panels in @fig-poc show the outcomes for different training procedures using the same model architecture each time (a linear classifier). In each case, we show the linear decision boundary (green) and the training data colored according to their ground-truth label: orange points belong to the target class, $y^+=2$, blue points belong to the non-target class, $y^-=1$. Stars indicate counterfactuals in the target class generated at test time using generic gradient descent for a fixed number of iterations.

In panel (a), we have trained our model conventionally, and we do not impose mutability constraints at test time. The generated counterfactuals are all valid, but not plausible: they are clearly distinguishable from the ground-truth data. In panel (b), we have trained our model with counterfactual training, once again not imposing mutability constraints at test time. We observe that the counterfactuals are clearly plausible, therefore meeting the first objective of @def-explainability.

In panel (c), we have used conventional training again, this time imposing the mutability constraint on *age* at test time. Counterfactuals are valid but involve some substantial reductions in *debt* for some individuals, in particular very young applicants. By comparison, counterfactual paths are shorter on average in panel (d), where we have used counterfactual training and protected immutable features as described in @sec-constraints. In particular, we observe that due to the classifier's lower sensitivity to *age*, recourse recommendations with respect to *debt* are much more homogenous, in that they do not disproportionately punish younger individuals. The counterfactuals are also plausible with respect to the mutable feature. Thus, we consider the model in panel (d) as the most explainable according to @def-explainability.
