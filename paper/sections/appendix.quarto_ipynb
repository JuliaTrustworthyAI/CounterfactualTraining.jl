        "where $g: \\mathcal{Z} \\mapsto \\mathcal{X}$ is an invertible function that maps from the $L$-dimensional counterfactual state space to the feature space and $\\text{cost}(\\cdot)$ denotes one or more penalties that are used to induce certain properties of the counterfactual outcome. As above, $\\mathbf{y}^+$ denotes the target output and $\\mathbf{M}_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})$ returns the logit predictions of the underlying classifier for $\\mathbf{x}=g(\\mathbf{z})$.\n",
        "\n",
        "For all generators used in this work we use standard logit crossentropy loss for $\\text{yloss}(\\cdot)$. All generators also penalize the distance ($\\ell_1$-norm) of counterfactuals from their original factual state. For *Generic* and *ECCo*, we have $\\mathcal{Z}:=\\mathcal{X}$ and $g(\\mathbf{z})=g(\\mathbf{z})^{-1}=\\mathbf{z}$, that is counterfactual are searched directly in the feature space. Conversely, *REVISE* traverses the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE) fitted to the training data, where $g(\\cdot)$ corresponds to the decoder [@joshi2019realistic]. In addition to the distance penalty, *ECCo* uses an additional penalty component that regularizes the energy associated with the counterfactual, $\\mathbf{x}^\\prime$ [@altmeyer2024faithful]. \n",

        "### Convergence {#sec-app-conv}\n",
        "\n",
        "An important consideration when generating counterfactual explanations using gradient-based methods is how to define convergence. Two common choices are to 1) perform gradient descent over a fixed number of iterations $T$, or 2) conclude the search as soon as the predicted probability for the target class has reached a pre-determined threshold, $\\tau$: $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{M}_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}^\\prime))[y^+] \\geq \\tau$. We prefer the latter for our purposes, because it explicitly defines convergence in terms of the black-box model, $\\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining convergence in this way allows for a more intuitive interpretation of the resulting counterfactual outcomes than with fixed $T$. Specifically, it allows us to think of counterfactuals as explaining 'high-confidence' predictions by the model for the target class $y^+$. Depending on the context and application, different choices of $\\tau$ can be considered as representing 'high-confidence' predictions.\n"

Firstly, within the context of explainability and algorithmic recourse, real-world attributes are often domain constrained: the *age* feature, for example, is lower bounded by zero and upper bounded by the maximum human lifespan. Secondly, domain constraints help mitigate training instabilities commonly associated with energy-based modelling [@grathwohl2020your;@altmeyer2024faithful].\n",

For all other features $d$ in our synthetic and tabular datasets, we automatically infer domain constraints $[x_d^{\\text{LB}},x_d^{\\text{UB}}]$  as follows,\n",

        "We performed our experiments on a high-performance cluster. Details about the cluster will be disclosed upon publication to avoid revealing information that might interfere with the double-blind review process. Since our experiments involve highly parallel tasks and rather small models by today's standard, we have relied on distributed computing across multiple central processing units (CPU). Graphical processing units (GPU) were not required. Model training for the largest grid searches with 270 unique parameter combinations was parallelized across 34 CPUs with 2GB memory each. The time to completion varied by dataset for reasons discussed in @sec-discussion: 0h49m (*Moons*), 1h4m (*Linearly Separable*), 1h49m (*Circles*), 3h52m (*Overlapping*). Model evaluations for large grid searches were parallelized across 20 CPUs with 3GB memory each. Evaluations for all data sets took less than one hour (<1h) to complete. \n",
