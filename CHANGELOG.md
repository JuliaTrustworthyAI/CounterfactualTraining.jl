## Version [0.0.1] 

Tried different things here.

**Training schemes** Two main ideas: 1) simply use the energy differential between counterfactuals and observed samples in the target domain; 2) same as 1), but also compute the classification loss for the counterfactual prediction and target. The latter so far seems to have no effect on performance (does not seem to improve robustness).
