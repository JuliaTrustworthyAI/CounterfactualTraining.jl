## Approach/Future Directions

1. Limited to classification models.
2. Training instabilities.
3. Hyperparameter sensitivity -> can we do better than grid search? (Bayes opt, ...)

## Limitations

3. Proxy attributes of immutable features.
4. Increased training time.
5. Fairness and caveats (aware it's not a classical approach in this context, but there is a clear link).
