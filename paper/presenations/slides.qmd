## Status

- *Code base*: In place and streamlined for reproducibility and configuration. 
- *Experiments*: Lots of work done and results largely supportive of idea.
    - Ran into problems on DelftBlue, which has set me back about 2 weeks. 
- *Paper*: Still bare-bones. 
- *ICML*: Potentially still possible to submit something, but this will be rushed and not "finished".
