#### Linearly Separable 

- **Energy Penalty** (@tbl-lin_sep-lambda_energy_exper): *ECCo* generally does yield better results than *Vanilla* for higher choices of the energy penalty (10,15) during training. *Generic* performs poorly accross the board. *Omni* seems to have an anchoring effect, in that it never performs terribly but also never as good as the best *ECCo* results. *REVISE* performs poorly across the board.
- **Cost (distance penalty)**: Results for all generators (except *Omni*) are quite bad, which can likely be attributed to extremely bad results for some choices of the **Energy Penalty** (results here are averaged). For *ECCo* and *Generic*, higher cost values generally lead to worse results.
- **Maximum Iterations**: No clear patterns recognizable, so it seems that smaller choices are ok. 
- **Validity**: *ECCo* almost always valid except for very low values during training and high values at evaluation time. *Generic* often has poor validity.
- **Accuracy**: Seems largely unaffected.

#### Moons

- **Energy Penalty** (@tbl-moons-lambda_energy_exper): *ECCo* consistently yields better results than *Vanilla*, except for very low choices of the energy penalty during training for which it performs abismal. *Generic* performs quite badly across the board for high enough choices of the energy penalty at evaluation time. *Omni* has small positive effect. *REVISE* performs poorly across the board.
- **Cost (distance penalty)**: *Generic* generally does better for higher values, while *ECCo* does better for lower values.
- **Maximum Iterations**: No clear patterns recognizable, so it seems that smaller choices are ok. 
- **Validity**: *ECCo* generally achieves full validity except for very low choices the energy penalty during training and high choices at evaluation time. *Generic* performs poorly for high choices of the energy penalty during evaluation.
- **Accuracy**: Largely unaffected although *ECCo* suffers a bit for very low choices the energy penalty during training. *REVISE* suffers a lot in general (around 10 percentage points).

```{julia}
df = CSV.read("$(gen_params_dir)/moons/evaluation/results/ce/objective---lambda_energy_exper---lambda_energy_eval/plausibility_distance_from_target.csv", DataFrame)
df = groupby(df, Not(:run, :std, :mean, :lambda_energy_eval)) |>

#### Circles

- **Energy Penalty** (@tbl-circles-lambda_energy_exper): *ECCo* consistently yields better results than *Vanilla*, though primarily for low to medium choices of the energy penalty (<=5) during training. The same goes for *Generic*, which sometimes outperforms *ECCo* (for small energy penalty at evaluation time). *Omni* does alright for lower energy penalty at evaluation time, but loses out for higher choices. *REVISE* performs poorly across the board (except very low choices at evaluation time).
- **Cost (distance penalty)**: *ECCo* and *Generic* generally achieve the best results when no cost penalty is used during training. Both *Omni* and *REVISE* are largely unaffected.
- **Maximum Iterations**: *ECCo* consistently yields better results for higher numbers of iterations. *Generic* generally does best for a medium number (50). *Omni* is sometimes invalid (**???**).
- **Validity**: *ECCo* tends to outperform its *Vanilla* counterpart, though primarily for low to medium choices of the energy penalty (<=5) during training and evaluation. *Vanilla* typically worse across the board.
- **Accuracy**: Mostly unaffected, but *REVISE* again consistently some deterioration and *ECCo* deteriorates for high choices of energy penalty during training, reflecting other outcomes above.
